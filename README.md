## External dependencies
- None so far

*Note*: Just Cause 4 (and potentially other Avalanche games) uses Oodle (`oo2core_7_win64.dll`) to de/compress files.
Once support for Just Cause 4 is rolled out, this will be required.

I am unable to share this file due to licensing, but if you have the game it should be located in your installation folder.
